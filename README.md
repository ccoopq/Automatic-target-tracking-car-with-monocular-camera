# Automatic-target-tracking-car-with-monocular-camera

### Overview
The project aimed to design a real-time automatic target tracking vehicle equipped with a monocular camera, focusing on cost-effective and efficient autonomous navigation and surveillance.

This is a final project of ME5400A.

### Methodology
Employed YOLOv5 for object detection method and TrackerKCF for continuous object tracking.

Realtime performance on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, a resource-limited edge computing device.

Developed a vehicle control algorithm to translate visual data into actionable navigation commands with PWM and adjusted speed and steering based on the objectâ€™s location and distance.

### Experiments
Tested the system's tracking capabilities in various scenarios, including straight-line and curved paths.

Introduced a "searching mode" to re-engage tracking after losing the target.
